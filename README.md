# Project Herophilus

Welcome to [Project Herophilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herophilos), this organization is intended to be an open source upstream healthcare development community. The intent of this organization is to help showcase how Open Source can help drive innovation in healthcare specific to any and all aspects of data!!! Why the name? Herophilus, was a Greek physician who is often credited with being the founder of Anatomy. We felt this name is fitting as the intent of this effort is to showcase and put forward upstream open source innovation that can help simply healthcare's ability to access and process data.

Several of the capabilities contained within this organization are already used within other organization and we are so proud that these open contributions can help our healthcare.
