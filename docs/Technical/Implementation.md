# intelligent DaaS Partner Implementations
iDaaS is enabling organizations to make data a product and build assets on top of it. 
Because <b>"Data is the asset!!!"</b> iDaaS is about enabling information for knowledge 
that can be used for action in a secure and scalable manner. Along with helping 
organizations it is also being used and adopted by numerous system integrators .
Since doing our first release in May of 2020 we have seen so appreciate of those 
customers and systems integrators that have  implemented their solution or solutions 
powered with iDaaS.
